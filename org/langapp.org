** algorithm
  1 type letter
  if letter is next letter
    letter appears in black
  elif letter is in word
    letter appears in yellow
  else 
    letter appears in red in scratch bucket
  repeat till word filled
  
** experimental
*** deblur the text
    As the learner types incorrect letters deblur the text
*** show num letters?
** implementation ideas
*** spans for individual letters
    each letter is in a span.  change it's appearance from transparent, yellow, red, black
*** word and alphabet
    store word as array with pointer to current letter.  dict as array with each cell having 3 properties(letter,entity,value)
    value = unselected, selected-out-of-order, selected-error, selected-correct
    unselected = dim and fuzzy
